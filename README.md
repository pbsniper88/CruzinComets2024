# CruzinComets2024
Baseline Robot OS Software for 2024 Season
This swerve drive based code has been completely rebuilt from the 2023 season.

## Drive train
Swerve drive based drive train.
MA3 absolute analog encoders connected to Talon SRX and analog breakout boards.

Java drive train programmed to use Talon SRX PID control through Motion Magic.
Tuning with this baseline is still required. 

### Performance Status
This system has been tested with a single xbox controller and the robot lifted off the ground.
No tuning has been performed and the wheels were only confirmed to turn in the correct direction.
"forward vs backwards" inversion may still be required. 
All 4 wheels are operational at this time.
